        <h1>In society, people can be very judgemental and they treat others differently,like woman get treat differently.Like certain jobs men get hired and woman dont,some people say that men are better at this then women or viseversa so they dont get treated equaly</h1>
        <h2> This is important to me because i have experienced this in my life when people have told me before that i can't be good at something because my brother should be good at because he is a boy.I find that unfair because we can both be good at just because we are different genders </h2>
